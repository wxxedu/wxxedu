# Hi there 👋

Nice to meet you! My name is Xiuxuan Wang and you can call me sushi. I love coding 🖥️, watching k-dramas 📺 and listening to k-pop 🎸. 

- My favorite 🎥 k-drama is [Because This Is My First Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Because_This_Is_My_First_Life); 
- My favorite 👧🏻 korean actress is [Jung So-min](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jung_So-min); 
- My favorite 🎧 k-pop idol is [IU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IU_(singer)).

⭐️⭐️⭐️ Check them out! They are awesome! ⭐️⭐️⭐️

**Fun Facts**:

- I use macs for programming but I **HATE** Apple. 

- I **LOVE** mocking business students & business classes. Do they even have hands? *(Oh they have a brilliant idea💡 that only needs some enginneers to build it out!)*

  *(FYI there was this Microsoft AI4A hackathon thingy that I attended. We wrote around 10k LoC. Yet the one of the winners was some random business dude that shows off a pair of sunglasses that he bought somewhere claiming that it was their revolutionary product? Come on! WTF. I blacklist Microsoft for this reason.)*

- I **HATE** hackathons. *(See the reason above! ⬆)*

- I **SWEAR** that I will not invest a single penny of my money into the stock market. 

  *(It is not my expertise and believing that you can predict the future based on some mathematical models feels ridiculous to me)*.

- I **HATE** general education -- they are such a waste of time!

## 🎯 Current Affiliation

- I am currently a year 3 student at National University of Singapore (NUS) studying Mathematics & Computer Science;
