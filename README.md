  <summary>I use 💻Macs for programming but I <b>HATE</b> 🍎Apple.</summary>

> **Why I use a 💻Mac**
> - The first computer that I owned is a MacBook Air 2015. After eight years of using MacOS, I really could not get used to other operating systems.
> - I am a **mobile developer**. Having a Mac means that I could build and test apps for both Android and iOS. 
> - I used to code mostly in the terminal, using either [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) or [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/). The Mac terminal being unix-compatible is just so convenient to me. 
> 
> **Why I HATE 🍎Apple**
> - Apple is against [🛠️right to repair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair) movement, which I strongly believe in. 
> - Apple has the **worst** developer documentation.

    <summary>I <b>LOVE</b> mocking business schools & business school students.</summary>
  
> I think that business schools cannot teach students anything -- and business students do not know much. [^1]  
> Come'on, what do they even learn? Do they even have hands?
> 
> FYI there was this "MacroHard" AI4A hackathon thingy that I attended. We wrote around 10k LoC. Yet the one of the winners was some random business dudes that show off a pair of sunglasses that they bought somewhere claiming that it was their revolutionary product. Come on! WTF. I blacklist "MacroHard" for this reason.  

[^1]: Just to be safe, when I refer to business school students, I intend to mean those who studies business because they want to be a tech entrepreneur that sort of thing. *"Oh I have a brilliant idea that's going to earn me billions of dollars -- and all I need is just someone who can build it out for me."*  ⃪ Do you even have hands?

    <summary>I <b>HATE</b> hackathons🕶️. They are useless.</summary>
    
> ⬆⬆⬆ See the previous point! ⬆⬆⬆
> 
> All of my hackathon[^2] experiences are not pleasant. There was this SDG hackathon where we got some random IBD guy denying all the ideas that we had. Frankly speaking, I think that none of the guys in the SDG hackathon cared about sustainability. If anything, holding a hackathon would not help at all and the hackathon just appeared to be some large-corporation PR thing. 
> 
> When I am interning at my current company [Exxentric](https://exxentric.com/), which isn't a big company, I was quite astonished when my colleagues started discussing the carbon footprint of our products. -- this is giving true care for the environment, not some random **BS** that the big tech come up with. 
> 
> Giving fair credit to hackathons, they are a good place to socialize and make friends. They are a good place for beginners to try out coding and experiment with their ideas. Don't expect more.

[^2]: here by hackathons I refer to the hackathons that I attended, which mainly are just college level hackathons. I don't know if there are more advanced hackathons that maybe somewhat useful.

    <summary>I will <b>NOT</b> invest a single 💰penny of my money into the stock market, -- at least not without the knowledge that I am gambling.</summary>

> - I believe that the world is of a higher dimension than the one that we can observe. It's like cutting a 3D space using a plane. Observing from the plane, there is no way for you to know how the outside 3D space looks like -- and the plane may even be curved, who knows! Therefore, it seems ridiculous to me that some mathematical models would be able predict how the stock market goes. 
> - There are only so many things that I can be good at. Currently, programming and trying to build a small software company consumes the majority of my energy. I don't want to spend energy on learning some other things.

<details>
    <summary>I <b>HATE</b> general education courses. They are a waste of time.</summary>
    
> To be more specific, by general education I refer to the general education that I experienced at College of Humanities and Sciences (CHS) at NUS. I have since switched to School of Compting (SoC) and I am now a proud SoC student. My argument against GE may be a CHS-specific thing, where as a student you are **FORCED** to learn the predetermined courses -- without given the freedom of choice. 
> 
> My argument against **GE** in CHS are as follows:
> - Since the GE courses are designed for the whole cohort, they lack the academic rigor that's required from introductory courses of each department.
> - They consume your S/U options (in NUS we are given 8 S/U opportunities, which means that there are 8 courses that you can choose to take with Sastifactory / Unsatisfactory as your grade). This prevents me from exploring the areas that interest me.

<details>
<summary>I <b>HATE</b> LeetCode. Everyone knows it's shit💩 yet everyone uses it.</summary>

> - LeetCode has **ABSOLUTELY NOTHING** to do with software engineering.
> - There are only two kinds of problems on LeetCode:
>   - Problems that are too easy and are a waste of time to solve.
>   - Problems that are too hard and either would never appear in algorithmic interviews or I would not be able to solve them anyways if they appear.  
> - I tried LeetCode once, and I have since decided to focus on my own projects which are much much more interesting. If one company is going to reject me based on some stupid algorithmic interview, I would say f\*ck to that company.

## ⚙️ Skills & Strengths

### Languages & Frameworks

<details>
<summary>Dart & Flutter: Experienced</summary>

> #### Experience
> 
> I started writing Dart & Flutter since Jan. 2022. I am intimately familiar with the details of Dart & Flutter down to the basics. 
> 
> #### Projects in Dart & Flutter 
> 
> - [Dynote](www.dynote.io): a dynamic note-taking app that I have been working on for more than a year now.
> - [福 (fu)](https://github.com/wxxedu/fu): 福 (FU) is a recurring text-generator that helps you deal with the boring chores of life such as daily reflections.
> - Reflet (unreleased, closed source): a spending tracker that aims to help you improve your spending habbits. 
> - [SimpleSM](https://github.com/wxxedu/simple_sm): a simple state management solution that I built to help me understand the basics of state management behind Dart/Flutter.
> - [CopyPaste](https://github.com/CopyPaste-Orbital2022/copypaste): one of my first projects with Flutter, where I intend to allow you to draw something on the tablet and paste it on your computer. It's pretty shitty code :)
> - [my_popup_menu](https://github.com/wxxedu/my_popup_menu): an iOS-like popup menu implementation in Flutter. (It's quite complicated!)
> - [selectable_items](https://github.com/wxxedu/selectable_items): a shared widget library to allow for selecting items. (I forgot what I did with this lmao)

<summary>Rust: Very Comfortable</summary>

> #### Experience
> 
> I become obssessed with Rust in early 2023, and I wrote a lot of code in Rust since. 
> 
> #### Projects
> 
> TBD
</details>

<details>
<summary>TypeScript & React (Native): Comfortable</summary>

> #### Experience
> 
> I use TypeScript & React Native for work at [Exxentric](https://exxentric.com/). I am comfortable with writing TS & RN, but I just have to say that TS & RN are objectively worse than Dart & Flutter. They really are!
> 
> #### Projects
> 
> TBD (I will summary this up once I finish my internship at Exxentric)
</details>


<details>
<summary>Swift & SwiftUI: Comfortable</summary>

> #### Experience
> 
> Swift is the first programming language that I learnt. I learnt it way back in 2014. The first few of my projects are built in Swift & UIKit using storyboards. I love the elegance of the language. 
> 
> I would say that I am very comfortable with Swift / SwiftUI, but I do not know as much about the libraries in the Swift ecosystem because it has not been my tech choice for quite some time. I still enjoy it a lot every time when I try to write something in Swift / SwiftUI. 
> 
> #### Projects
>
> TBD (I'll need to spend some time cleaning up things)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Java: Comfortable</summary>

> #### Experience
> 
> It's a boring language -- one that I don't have to think much about when I write it. I used it a lot for my school work. 
> 
> #### Projects
> 
> TBD
</details>

<details>
<summary>C: Entry Level</summary>

> #### Experience
> 
> I've only used this language for 2 of my courses: [CS2100](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2100/computer-organisation) & [CS2106](https://nusmods.com/courses/CS2106/introduction-to-operating-systems). I do plan to use it a little more in some of the future projects because I think it is a good language -- much better than C++ as I assume.

> #### Projects

> TBD
